Two flavors of edits.
The first one I made is the basic one; pretty much normal WandWorkshop2.0 except if your wand is better than the sacrifice in a given stat, it steals some % of it, letting you "farm" wand stats.

The advanced version creates a new pillar, the omni pillar, which siphons less (configurable) but lets you absorb all a wand's abilities at once.
